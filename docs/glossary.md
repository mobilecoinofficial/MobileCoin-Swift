| Mixins                      | Random coins that are included in transactions to preserve the privacy of the sender by mixing in random coins from the ledger with the coins the user wants to spend.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| TxOuts                      | Transaction oOutputs where every transaction uses TxOuts as inputs to create TxOuts as the output of a transaction, similar to a coin.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Merkle Proofs of Membership | A privacy measure for senders of MOB. MobileCoin preserves the privacy of the sender by mixing in random coins from the ledger (mixins) with the coins the user wants to spend. A Merkle Proof of Membership is provided with each mixin as proof that the input is included in the MobileCoin Ledger, so that new coins cannot be forged. |
