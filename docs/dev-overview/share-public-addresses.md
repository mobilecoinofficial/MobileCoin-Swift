# Share public addresses

### User experience

Users can share **public addresses** from their MobileCoin wallet app with other individuals, and enable transactions to occur between the two usersâ€™ smartphones.

In order for new users to share their public addresses from their MobileCoin wallet on their smartphone, they must generate their request code after they enter the amount of a transaction to send.

{% hint style="info" %}
Users can share their public addresses without sending a transaction.
{% endhint %}

### Implementation

As an iOS/SWIFT developer, you will need the following code to enable the user to generate a request code:

```swift
let bytes = account.publicAddress
.serializedProtoBytes
/* -------------------------- */
let recipient = PublicAddress(
serializedProtoBytes: bytes)
```
