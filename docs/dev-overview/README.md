# Developing the code for a MobileCoin wallet app

When developing a MobileCoin wallet app, you will need to utilize code for the following:

1. [Create an account key.](create-account-key.md)
2. [Share public addresses.](share-public-addresses.md)
3. [Get the current balance.](get-balance.md)
4. [Send a transaction.](send-transaction.md)
5. [Calculate the transaction fee.](calculate-fee.md)
6. [Check the transaction status (for the sender).](check-transaction-status.md)
7. [Check the transaction receipts (for the recipient).](transaction-receipts.md)

The Integration Guide provides the following structure for each section of functionality needed:

1. What the _user sees and experiences_ when using your MobileCoin wallet app; and
2. _The code_ you as the developer need to create in your mobile wallet app for an iOS mobile device.

These two elements provide the goal (_user experience_) and code (_implementation_) for successful implementation of the MobileCoin functionality.
