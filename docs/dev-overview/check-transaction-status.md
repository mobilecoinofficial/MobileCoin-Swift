### Implementation

As an iOS/SWIFT developer, you will need the following code to enable the user to check their transaction status:

```swift
let status = accountOps.status(

transaction: transaction)
```

The code provided by the MobileCoin SDK enables the users to access a secure, pre-processed version of their data on the MobileCoin Ledger in MobileCoin Fog Services through their mobile wallet app.
